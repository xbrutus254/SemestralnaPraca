Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the solar system.
Only the Sun, Moon and Venus are brighter. It is one of five planets visible 
to the naked eye from Earth.
The ancient Babylonians were the first to record their sightings of Jupiter.
This was around the 7th or 8th century BC. Jupiter is named after the king of 
the Roman gods. To the Greeks, it represented Zeus, the god of thunder. 
The Mesopotamians saw Jupiter as the god Marduk and patron of the city of Babylon. 
Germanic tribes saw this planet as Donar, or Thor.
Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets.
It turns on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. The rapid rotation 
flattens the planet slightly, giving it an oblate shape.
Jupiter orbits the Sun once every 11.8 Earth years.
From our point of view on Earth, it appears to move slowly in the sky, taking 
months to move from one constellation to another.
Jupiter has unique cloud features.
The upper atmosphere of Jupiter is divided into cloud belts and zones. They 
are made primarily of ammonia crystals, sulfur, and mixtures of the two compounds.
