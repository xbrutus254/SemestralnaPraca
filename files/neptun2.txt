Neptune was not known to the ancients.
It is not visible to the naked eye and was first observed in 1846. 
Its position was determined using mathematical predictions. 
It was named after the Roman god of the sea.
Neptune spins on its axis very rapidly.
Its equatorial clouds take 16 hours to make one rotation. 
This is because Neptune is not solid body.
Neptune is the smallest of the ice giants.
Despite being smaller than Uranus, Neptune has a greater mass. 
Below its heavy atmosphere, Uranus is made of layers of hydrogen, 
helium, and methane gases. They enclose a layer of water, 
ammonia and methane ice. The inner core of the planet is made of rock.
The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen and helium, with some methane.
The methane absorbs red light, which makes the planet appear a 
lovely blue. High, thin clouds drift in the upper atmosphere.
Neptune has a very active climate.
Large storms whirl through its upper atmosphere, and high-speed 
winds track around the planet at up 600 meters per second. 
One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. 
It was called the Great Dark Spot. It lasted about five years.
