Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest planet in the solar 
system. It's the farthest planet from Earth that's visible to the naked human eye, 
but the planet's most outstanding features — its rings — are better viewed through a 
telescope. Although the other gas giants in the solar system — Jupiter, 
Uranus and Neptune —  also have rings, Saturn's rings are particularly prominent, 
earning it the nickname the "Ringed Planet."
