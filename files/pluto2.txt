In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, a change widely thought 
of as a demotion. The question of Pluto's planet status has attracted 
controversy and stirred debate in the scientific community, and among 
the general public, since then. In 2017, a science 
group (including members of the New Horizon mission) proposed a new 
definition of planethood based on "round objects in space smaller 
than stars," which would make the number of planets in our solar system 
expand from 8 to roughly 100.
American astronomer Percival Lowell first caught hints of Pluto's 
existence in 1905 from odd deviations he observed in the orbits of 
Neptune and Uranus, suggesting that another world's gravity was tugging 
at these two planets from beyond. Lowell predicted the mystery planet's 
location in 1915, but died without finding it. Pluto was finally 
discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory, 
based on predictions by Lowell and other astronomers.
