Venus is the second brightest natural object in the sky. 
The planet has an apparent magnitude of -3.8 to -4.6, which makes it visible on 
a bright, clear day. The Moon is the only other natural object that is brighter.
Venus is sometimes referred to as the “morning star” and “evening star”. 
This dates back to ancient civilizations who believed that Venus was in fact 
two distinct stars appearing in the sky. When the orbit of Venus overtakes Earth’s 
orbit, it changes from being visible at sunrise to being visible at sunset. 
They were known as Phosphorus and Hesperus by the Greeks, and Lucifer and Vesper 
by the Romans.
One day on Venus is longer than one year. Due to the slow rotation on its axis, 
it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation. The orbit of the planet takes 
225 Earth-days – making a year on Venus shorter on day on Venus.
Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. This may be, 
in part, due the brightness of the planet and may date back to the 
Babylonians in 1581 who referred to Venus as “bright queen of the sky”.
