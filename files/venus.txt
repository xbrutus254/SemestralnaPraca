Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the third brightest object in Earth's 
sky after the Sun and Moon. It is sometimes referred to as the sister planet to 
Earth, because their size and mass are so similar. Venus is also the closest 
planet to Earth. The surface of Venus is hidden by an opaque layer of clouds
 which are formed from sulphuric acid.
