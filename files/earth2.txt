Earth has a diameter of roughly 13,000 kilometers and is round because gravity 
pulls matter into a ball. But, it's not perfectly round. Earth is really an 
"oblate spheroid," because its spin causes it to be squashed at its poles 
and swollen at the equator.

Water covers roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface, and most of that is in the oceans. 
About a fifth of Earth's atmosphere consists of oxygen, produced by plants. 
While scientists have been studying our planet for centuries, much has been 
learned in recent decades by studying pictures of Earth from space.
