Pluto, once considered the ninth and most distant planet from the sun, 
is now the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system. 
It is also one of the largest known members of the Kuiper Belt, 
a shadowy zone beyond the orbit of Neptune thought to be populated 
by hundreds of thousands of rocky, icy bodies each larger than 100 kilometers 
across, along with 1 trillion or more comets.
