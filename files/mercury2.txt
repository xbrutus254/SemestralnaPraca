Because the planet is so close to the sun, Mercury's surface temperature can reach a 
scorching 450 degrees Celsius. However, since this world doesn't have much of a real 
atmosphere to entrap any heat, at night temperatures can plummet to minus 170 C, a 
temperature swing of more than 600 degree C, the greatest in the solar system.

Mercury is the smallest planet â€” it is only slightly larger than Earth's moon. 
Since it has no significant atmosphere to stop impacts, the planet is pockmarked 
with craters. About 4 billion years ago, an asteroid 100 kilometers wide struck 
Mercury with an impact equal to 1 trillion 1-megaton bombs, creating a vast impact 
crater roughly 1,550 km wide. Known as the Caloris Basin, this crater could hold 
the entire state of Texas. Another large impact may have helped create the planet's 
odd spin.
