The bright rust color Mars is known for is due to iron-rich minerals in 
its regolith â€” the loose dust and rock covering its surface. 
The soil of Earth is a kind of regolith, too, albeit one loaded 
with organic content. According to NASA, the iron minerals oxidize, 
or rust, causing the soil to look red.

The cold, thin atmosphere means liquid water likely cannot exist on the 
Martian surface for any length of time. Features called recurring 
slope lineae may have spurts of briny water flowing on the surface, 
but this evidence is disputed; some scientists argue the hydrogen 
spotted from orbit in this region may instead indicate briny salts. 
This means that although this desert planet is just half the diameter 
of Earth, it has the same amount of dry land.
