Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781.
It is too dim to have been seen by the ancients. At first Herschel thought it 
was a comet, but several years later it was confirmed as a planet. 
Herscal tried to have his discovery named “Georgian Sidus” after 
King George III. The name Uranus was suggested by astronomer Johann Bode. 
The name comes from the ancient Greek deity Ouranos.
Uranus turns on its axis once every 17 hours, 14 minutes.
The planet rotates in a retrograde direction, opposite to the way 
Earth and most other planets turn.
Uranus makes one trip around the Sun every 84 Earth years.
During some parts of its orbit one or the other of its poles point 
directly at the Sun and get about 42 years of direct sunlight. 
The rest of the time they are in darkness.
Uranus is often referred to as an “ice giant” planet.
Like the other gas giants, it has a hydrogen upper layer, which has 
helium mixed in. Below that is an icy “mantle, which surrounds a 
rock and ice core. The upper atmosphere is made of water, ammonia 
and the methane ice crystals that give the planet its pale blue colour.
Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of any planet.
With minimum atmospheric temperature of -224°C Uranus is nearly 
coldest planet in the solar system. While Neptune doesn’t get as 
cold as Uranus it is on average colder. The upper atmosphere of Uranus 
is covered by a methane haze which hides the storms that take place in the cloud decks.
